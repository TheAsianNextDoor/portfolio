# Dev Tools

## Scss Modules

In order to have type-safe scss modules a `d.ts` file must be made with corresponding types. It would be tedious to create all those files, so a vite plugin does it for us [vite-plugin-sass-dts](https://github.com/activeguild/vite-plugin-sass-dts#readme). To leverage this wonderful plugin simply start the dev server and the plugin will auto create/update the types for you! Happy styling ðŸŽ¨

## VsCode

`Debug on Chrome` - Launch the project in a chrome instance and allow inline Vscode debugging. This chrome instance's user data profile resides inside this directory - `.vscode/vscode-chrome-debug-userdatadir/`. This ensures a fresh environment to test against and also allows developers to segregate their personal and developer Chrome instance (highly recommend)

`Test and Watch Current File` - Runs Vitest in watch mode on the currently focused file in editor
